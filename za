Hi Vishal,

Please find my feedback below:

For Chapter Lead (Regis):
Regis has been very supportive throughout the year. Our bi-weekly connects have been extremely valuable in discussing progress, addressing challenges, and receiving constructive guidance. He continuously encourages me in every aspect of my work and always recognizes my efforts. Regis creates such a positive environment that I feel comfortable reaching out to him anytime for support or clarification.

For Product Owner (Shiva):
Shiva has been very supportive and approachable, maintaining regular connects to discuss work updates and priorities. His clear communication and timely feedback have helped me stay aligned with project goals. He also creates an open environment where I feel comfortable reaching out anytime to discuss ideas or concerns.

Thank you for your continued support and guidance.

Best regards,
