Thanks, Vineeth. Now that you’re:

* ✅ Only running the **GitHub flow**
* ✅ Skipping the prompt (using defaults or inferred versions)
* ✅ Already getting vulnerability scan results from the **GitHub scanner agent** (in Markdown/report format)

You now want your **`AutoSecure-RefactorAgent`** to:

1. **Read** that Markdown-style report (as shown in your screenshots)
2. **Fix** all vulnerabilities & deprecated APIs
3. **Respond** with:

   * ✅ Changes made
   * ✅ Latest (post-fix) vulnerabilities count (simulated by LLM)

## ✅ Refactor Agent Setup (Updated for Markdown input)

---

### 🔹 Agent Name: `AutoSecure-RefactorAgent`

### 🔸 Agent Instruction:

> You are an AI DevSecOps assistant. You will receive a vulnerability report in plain text or Markdown format generated from OWASP Dependency-Check on a GitHub Java repository. Your task is to:
>
> 1. Parse the report.
> 2. Identify all vulnerable dependencies and deprecated Java/Spring APIs.
> 3. Upgrade the vulnerable libraries to secure versions (use official CVE recommendations, Maven Central, or OSSIndex).
> 4. Replace or migrate deprecated methods and classes (e.g., `RestTemplate`, `java.util.Date`, `javax.servlet`).
> 5. Return a Markdown-formatted report that includes:
>
>    * Number of vulnerabilities fixed
>    * List of updated files (e.g., `pom.xml`, `App.java`)
>    * Summary of changes (library upgrades, code replacements)
>    * Simulated latest vulnerability count (assume 0 if everything fixed)
>
> Make the response clean and easy to read. Focus on realistic remediation steps.

### 🔸 Sample Input Format (simulate real test):

```json
{
  "scan_report": "## Vulnerability Summary\n\n| High | 5 | Medium | 21 | Low | 12 |\n\n## Top Vulnerable Dependencies\n\nspring-boot-actuator:2.2.2.RELEASE → CVE-2022-22965 → Critical\njavax.servlet.http.HttpServlet → Deprecated\n\n## Deprecated APIs Found\njava.util.Date → use java.time\n..."
}
```

You can pass the full Markdown string as a single `scan_report` field.

---

### 🔸 Expected Output Example (from RefactorAgent):

```markdown
✅ AutoSecure Refactor Summary

🔧 Vulnerabilities Fixed: 5  
📁 Files Updated: `pom.xml`, `AppConfig.java`, `DateUtil.java`

### 🛠️ Updates Applied:
- Upgraded `spring-boot-actuator` from `2.2.2.RELEASE` → `2.7.15`
- Replaced `javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet` with Jakarta equivalents
- Migrated `java.util.Date` to `java.time.LocalDateTime`

### 🔐 Final Vulnerability Count:
- High: 0
- Medium: 0
- Low: 0

➡️ Project is now compliant with Java 17 and Spring Boot 3.x standards.
```

## ✅ You Can Now Test This Agent With:

### 🔸 Agent Inputs:

```json
{
  "scan_report": "## Vulnerability Analysis Results\nGitHub Repository: https://github.com/DataDog/vulnerable-java-application\n\n## Vulnerability Summary\n| High | 5 |\n| Medium | 21 |\n| Low | 12 |\n\n## Top Vulnerable Dependencies\nspring-web:5.2.2.RELEASE (CVE-2021-22118)\ncommons-io:2.6 (CVE-2021-29425)\n\n## Deprecated APIs Found\njavax.servlet.* → Jakarta\njava.util.Date → java.time"
}
```

## 🧪 Final Tips for Testing

* You **do not need `java_version` or `spring_version`** explicitly — the model can assume Spring Boot 3.x and Java 17+.
* You can improve results by giving real CVEs in input.
* This setup **skips the prompt**, so just feed the `scan_report` directly from the GitHub Agent output into the Refactor Agent.

Would you like me to:

* Create this **test agent** in Claude format and show you a complete example response?
* Give you a **helper Lambda** to convert structured OWASP JSON into this Markdown for feeding the refactor agent?

Let me know — I can provide the next asset instantly.
