Rewrite these tests using JUnit 5 and Spring Boot test best practices.

Ensure each test is discoverable and runnable with JUnit 5 (@Test).

Use the right Spring Boot test annotations (@SpringBootTest, @WebMvcTest, @DataJpaTest) depending on whatâ€™s being tested.

Add meaningful assertions that validate real service/controller/repository behavior.

Include both positive and negative test cases.

Use Mockito (or @MockBean) to mock external dependencies where needed.

Keep the tests small, isolated, readable, and suitable for CI pipelines.
