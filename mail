Subject: Exam Rescheduling and Updates

Dear Team,

Yes, I will be attending the exam in July. I had initially planned to take it on July 6th but did not follow up. I would now like to confirm that I will be taking the exam on July 13th.

Please find the updates below:

✅ I will be taking the exam on July 13th.

✅ I will update the status on Lex as soon as I pass the exam.

✅ I will also update the information on the AWS Voucher Allocation Portal.


Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
