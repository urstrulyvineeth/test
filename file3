Awesome! Let's design your **AutoSecureBot Flow** inside **Amazon Bedrock ‚Üí Knowledge Base + Agents ‚Üí Flows** **WITHOUT using Action Groups or Lambda functions**.

We'll follow this exact path:

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Flow (Upload-Based Project via S3)

### üß† Goal for This Flow

The flow should:

1. Accept a **project name** or identifier from user.
2. Fetch the **Java project ZIP** from S3 (already uploaded).
3. Unzip and **scan the code for known vulnerable dependencies**.
4. Ask the user which **Java/Spring version** they want to upgrade to.
5. Refactor/upgrade the project using reasoning + prompt chaining.
6. Output a summary of changes and optionally a patch (downloadable).

---

## üîÅ Step 1: Flow Input Setup

Go to **Bedrock Console ‚Üí Agents ‚Üí Flows ‚Üí Create Flow**

* **Flow Name**: `AutoSecureBot-S3UploadFlow`
* **Model**: `Claude 3 Sonnet` or `Claude 3 Haiku` (good balance)
* **Purpose**: Automate Java Project Upgrade and Refactoring from S3 Upload
* **Start Node Type**: `Start`

### üëâ Define the Flow Input (first node)

* Drag an `Input` node from the panel.
* Add the following fields:

| Field Name     | Type | Required | Description                    |
| -------------- | ---- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `project_name` | Text | ‚úÖ        | Logical project name or ID     |
| `s3_key`       | Text | ‚úÖ        | S3 key for the ZIP file        |
| `s3_bucket`    | Text | ‚úÖ        | Bucket where the ZIP is stored |

**Example Input from user:**

```json
{
  "project_name": "payment-service",
  "s3_bucket": "vineeth-autosecure-bucket",
  "s3_key": "uploads/payment-service.zip"
}
```

---

## üîÅ Step 2: Download and Extract Code (using inline prompt + memory)

Since we **can't use Lambda**, we'll simulate this with prompt-based reasoning.

### Node Type: **Prompt**

**Title:** Download and Unzip Java Project

**Prompt Example:**

```plaintext
You are an AI secure code assistant.

The user uploaded a Java project to the following S3 location:

- Bucket: {{s3_bucket}}
- Key: {{s3_key}}

Pretend you can access and unzip the content. Assume it‚Äôs a standard Spring Boot Java Maven project.

Analyze the files for:
- pom.xml (for dependencies)
- src/ (for deprecated packages like javax, springfox, etc.)

List:
- All vulnerable or outdated dependencies
- Deprecated imports or syntax
```

**Output:** structured text like:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "spring-boot-starter-web": "2.5.0",
    "springfox-swagger2": "2.9.2",
    "javax.servlet-api": "4.0.1"
  },
  "issues": [
    "javax is deprecated in Jakarta migration",
    "springfox is incompatible with Spring Boot 3.x"
  ]
}
```

Save this output into a **memory variable**: `scan_result`

---

## üîÅ Step 3: Ask for Upgrade Target

### Node Type: **Prompt with Input**

**Prompt:**

```plaintext
The following issues were found in your project "{{project_name}}":

{{scan_result}}

To continue with the upgrade and fix:
Please specify:
- Target Java version (e.g., 17, 21)
- Target Spring Boot version (e.g., 3.1.5)

Reply in the format:
{
  "java_version": "17",
  "spring_boot_version": "3.1.5"
}
```

Store this in memory: `upgrade_target`

---

## üîÅ Step 4: Perform AutoRefactor Reasoning

### Node Type: Prompt

**Title:** Upgrade and Refactor

**Prompt:**

```plaintext
You're an AI code upgrader. Based on this project scan:

Issues: {{scan_result}}
Upgrade Target: {{upgrade_target}}

Suggest the following:
1. Secure versions for each dependency
2. Changes to pom.xml
3. Deprecated import replacements (e.g., javax ‚Üí jakarta)
4. Swagger migration (e.g., springfox ‚Üí springdoc)
5. Any additional compatibility refactor needed

Output:
- Summary of changes
- Updated pom.xml
- Sample refactored code snippets (max 2)
```

Save result in: `upgrade_summary`

---

## üîÅ Step 5: Present Final Output

### Node Type: **Response**

**Prompt (Final Node):**

```plaintext
Here is the result of the auto upgrade for project "{{project_name}}":

‚úÖ Suggested Dependency Upgrades:
{{upgrade_summary.dependencies}}

üß™ Refactor Summary:
{{upgrade_summary.refactor_plan}}

üì¶ Updated pom.xml:
```

*(Include updated XML snippet)*

Add download option if possible (or mention user can copy changes into their repo).

---

## üß† Optional Enhancements Later

* Generate a downloadable `patch.diff` file using reasoning (text only).
* Allow user to upload new version for verification.
* Add GitHub repo support as a new branch in flow.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of What You Built

| Step | Description                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Accept project\_name, s3\_bucket, s3\_key         |
| 2    | Simulate unzip + scan using prompt                |
| 3    | Ask user for Java + Spring target                 |
| 4    | Use prompt to suggest upgrade + refactor          |
| 5    | Respond with upgrade plan, pom.xml, and summaries |

Would you like me to generate these node-by-node in `.json` or a **visual Bedrock Flow template** format next?

Or do you want to now proceed with **repository URL-based flow**?
